  	<p>
  		The homepage of TypeCast has all the information you should need to get started.
	</p>
	<p>
		The homepage is <a href="./index.cfm">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A couple quick notes:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			This is pre-alpha software, bugs will occur. Please use
			<a href="http://typecast.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.addissue">the bug tracker</a>
			to report any bugs you find. Every attempt will be made to fix them promptly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Multiserver/J2EE installs have limited support. Please see index.cfm for more information.
		</li>
		<li>
			I use this myself every day, and it's very, very useful, at least to me. That's why I'm sharing it.
			I hope it proves as useful to you and makes your ColdFusion development experience that much
			more enjoyable.
		</li>
